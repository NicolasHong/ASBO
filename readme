The folder contains the python files of the four cases and the ipynb files called by each algorithm. For details of the algorithms developed in this article, see the bayes_opt_adaptive.py file. The code is developed based on the bayesian_optimization package. The link is as follows: https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization.

The botorch algorithm relies on the tr_bo.py file. For specific content, please refer to: https://botorch.org/tutorials/.

The python environment used and the version of each package are in the python_environment.json file.
